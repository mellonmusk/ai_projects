Week1

-Web crawling using BeautifulSoup, used 2 main domains and 100 related articles for each main domain 

-Used namuwiki articles which are written in korean, as source

-Then I made word clouds from collected data

Note: I wrote this notebook in jupyter notebook, not colab. You would also need a file of shape that you want for wordcloud and a font file in your local environment.
